# 🚀 Transformation Roadmap

> **A strategic planning framework for managing complex organizational change**

---

## 📋 How to Use This Template

The Transformation Roadmap helps you plan, communicate, and execute major organizational changes. Use it to:

- **Sequence initiatives** across multiple workstreams
- **Manage dependencies** between parallel efforts
- **Communicate progress** to stakeholders at all levels
- **Identify risks** before they derail your timeline

### Instructions

1. **Define the transformation** — What's the end state? Why does it matter?
2. **Break into workstreams** — Group initiatives by theme or capability
3. **Sequence phases** — Quick wins → Foundation → Scale → Optimize
4. **Map dependencies** — What must happen before what?
5. **Assign ownership** — Every initiative needs a single accountable owner
