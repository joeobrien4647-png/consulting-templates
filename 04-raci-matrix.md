# 📋 RACI Matrix

> **A responsibility assignment framework for clear accountability and decision-making**

---

## 📋 How to Use This Template

The RACI Matrix eliminates confusion about who does what. Use it to:

- **Clarify roles** — Everyone knows their responsibility
- **Prevent gaps** — No task falls through the cracks
- **Avoid duplication** — Reduce wasted effort
- **Speed decisions** — Clear escalation paths
- **Onboard faster** — New team members understand quickly

### Instructions

1. **List all activities** — Be specific, not generic
2. **Identify all roles** — Functions, not individuals (individuals change)
3. **Assign RACI codes** — One R per activity; C and I can be multiple
4. **Validate with stakeholders** — Get buy-in before publishing
5. **Review quarterly** — Update as the organization evolves

## ⚠️ Common RACI Problems & Solutions

### Red Flags to Watch For

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **No R** | Task has no one doing the work | Assign someone; if no one can, task may not be needed |
| **Multiple R's** | Confusion about who does what | Split activity into subtasks OR pick one R + one S |
| **No A** | No accountability; issues escalate poorly | Every activity needs ONE decision-maker |
| **Multiple A's** | Decisions stall; everyone waits | Only one A; others become C |
| **Too many C's** | Decisions take forever | Limit C to those with must-have input; move others to I |
| **R without authority** | Person blocked by lack of access/power | Ensure R has resources or add S roles |
| **A too far from work** | Accountability without understanding | A should be close enough to make informed decisions |

### Validation Checklist

For each activity:
- [ ] Exactly ONE R (Responsible)
- [ ] Exactly ONE A (Accountable) — can be same as R
- [ ] C's are truly needed (two-way communication required)
- [ ] I's are appropriately limited
- [ ] R has authority/resources to complete
- [ ] A has authority to make final decision

For each role:
- [ ] Not too many R's (capacity check)
- [ ] A's are appropriate seniority
- [ ] Balance across roles (no one overwhelmed)

- C > 20 activities: May slow decisions
- Total > 50: Consider role expansion

### Decision Speed Analysis

| Decision Type | # of C's | # of A's | Expected Speed |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Strategic | 3-5 | 1 | Days-Weeks |
| Operational | 1-2 | 1 | Hours-Days |

## 🔧 RACI Workshop Facilitation Guide

### Workshop Agenda (2 hours)

| Time | Activity | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| 0:00-0:15 | Introduction & RACI overview | Shared understanding |
| 0:15-0:45 | Brainstorm activities | Activity list |
| 0:45-1:00 | Define roles | Role list |

4. **Test with scenarios** — "When X happens, who does what?"
5. **Document disagreements** — Revisit after the meeting
